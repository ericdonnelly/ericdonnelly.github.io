            with topics in software and engineering is a unique challenge. As a junior engineer and storyteller, I am passionate about technical projects that drive insight and innovation to both businesses and people. Companies and organizations need a reliable team member that communicates development concepts effectively to clients, stakeholders, and collaborators. I am motivated to deliver precision and simplicity to topics in data science and machine learning to further interest and investment in the field.

				<b>Brick House</b> is an image recognition software and web application that distinguishes brick homes from siding homes with a predictive machine learning model. To utilize this image recognition model, users have two methods of user input. Users may enter an address and the application retrieves an image from the Google Streetview API or the user may upload their own image of a home. The program then returns a prediction based on the statistical likelihood that an image is brick, siding, or unknown. The highest percentage determines how the image is classified, however any prediction that is not at least 40% confident is classified as unknown.

				<b>Language Clusters</b> is an interactive data visualization that utilizes natural language processing techniques to display descriptions of UFO Sightings. From the initial view, the zoomable circle-packing visualization displays shapes that frequently appear in reports of UFO sightings. By clicking on a circle, the user sees the most common descriptions associated with the listed shape.  In both views, the size of the circle correlates with size of frequency. The textual data in the second view was parsed through the analysis of bigrams. Bigrams are two consecutive elements in a corpus of textual data. In this particular analysis, the two elements analyzed were a series of two consecutive words. The final product is a descriptive visualization that statistically correlates with the frequency that the phrases appear.

				<b>Sound Analytics</b> is a data visualization dashboard that explores audio features and genre classification. These audio features were extracted from the Spotify API. While my group and I initially investigated the differences in popularity between genre, key, and mode through a series of boxplots, data explorations in genre was later expanded by uncovering differences in the mean values of audio features for my favorite genres: electronic dance, ambient, and noise. The audio features categorized by genre were analyzed through a circular spider plot, bar charts, and scatter plots.

This project was later altered to incoporate my independent explorations of genre after course completion.</small>
